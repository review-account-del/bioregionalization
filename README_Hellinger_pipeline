mean_in = Hellinger values are scaled between 0 and 1, so this is a relative abundance measure.
            It represents how “typical” the species is within that cluster’s cells.

mean_out = Average Hellinger abundance of that same species outside the cluster — 
            across all      other clusters combined.
            This forms the baseline for comparison: how common is the species everywhere else?

delta = mean_in − mean_out; Positive delta → species is more abundant inside the cluster.
            Negative delta → species is less abundant (depleted).
            The larger the positive delta, the stronger the cluster-specificity.

cohen_d = High cohen_d values mean a strong and consistent separation. Standardized effect size, 
            i.e. how big the difference is relative to the variance in the data.

p = Tests whether the distribution of Hellinger values inside the cluster is significantly 
            greater than outside.

prevalence_in / prevalence_out = Proportion of cells where the species is present (>0) inside vs  
            outside the cluster. It’s a measure of how widespread the species is within that region. Helps distinguish between:
	    a rare but diagnostic species (low prevalence, high delta),a common background species (high prevalence everywhere).
            Example: prevalence_in = 0.85, prevalence_out = 0.05 → species occurs in 85% of cells inside, but only 5% elsewhere.

n_in / n_out = Number of cells considered “inside” vs “outside” that cluster. These tell you how 
            big each group was during testing. Useful for context (a small n_in = cluster with few cells → lower power).
